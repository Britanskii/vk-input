# VK-Input
VK-Input is an improved version of the dropdown component from VKontakte. In addition, it also includes an input field and a form, implemented using the useRef hook in React.
## Features
Optimized for performance
- Improved version of VKontakte's dropdown component
- Input field and form implemented using useRef
- Clean and organized code structure
## Optimizations
The VK-Input component has been optimized for performance in several ways:
- Memoization: the dropdown options are memoized using the useMemo hook, reducing unnecessary re-renders.
- Debouncing: the input field is debounced using the lodash debounce function, reducing unnecessary requests to the server.
